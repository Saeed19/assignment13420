#Executive Summary
This System framework helps developer and manager in settling on choices while building up the system, it concentrates on the combination of external sources being incorporated into the framework. As it may, external sources do not come be trusted for negligible vulnerability and licensing issues, in a programmer’s term, it doesn’t promise to deliver a bug free system. 

Utilizing the different segments of the framework both the developer and the manager can check the policies, vulnerability, and license information during the development along with approaches, redundancies and permitted data amongst other things. So, that the information can be put away in different databases and can be asked for by the manager or the developer in future operations.
This repository includes a level 0 Data Flow Diagram (DFD), three Use Cases, and a Data Dictionary. The main purpose of these documents is to manage the connection between the internal corporation and the external environment.

This repository is built while keeping in mind the management principles: Motivation, Organizational Structure, Authority & Control, 

Motivation:  The motivation behind this system is to manage the digital world as it advances. This system is meant to make reliable use of Open Source Software within the organization. Open Source Software is becoming more and more popular and usable for organizations. However, improper management of OSS diminishes the quality of OSS not only for the organization but also for the entire OSS community. This system ensures that OSS is not compromised on the basis of quality.

Organizational Structure: This new system encourages both management and developers to better interact with each other on the matters of their corporate interests while new software projects are being developed in context with the OSS licensing, policies, and vulnerabilities.

Authority & Control: The Manager is accountable and responsible for updating project/ package policies and overseeing software project license and vulnerability information. Whereas the Developer is responsible for developing new software and adhering to all license, policy, and vulnerabilities within the software while making sure that the code is bug free to the best of the developer’s ability.
